# Feline_GP_Annotation
Automated Phenotype-Genotype annotation from literature for feline study. This is a proposal for a project in BLAH9 which calls for collaboration to apply LLMs for feline genomics and informatics.

## Background
In recent years, cats have gained significant popularity globally, particularly in East Asia, where they have surpassed dogs as the most favored pets. This growing interest underscores the need for a comprehensive feline information database that can serve as a central resource for feline research. Such a database would be invaluable not only for advancing healthcare and precision medicine related to cats, but also for supporting broader feline studies and engaging the wider cat enthusiast community.
Genotype-phenotype mapping is the key of genetics. Over the past two decades, advances in sequencing technologies have revolutionized the ability to obtain large-scale genotype data quickly and cost-effectively. However, the acquisition of comprehensive phenotype information, particularly regarding diseases and morphological traits, remains limited. This is due to the lack of high-throughput methods for identifying and collecting phenotype data on a comparable scale as phenotype data are mostly reported by case studies. The disparity between the ease of obtaining genotypic versus phenotypic data highlights the potential of natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) to bridge this gap. By mining and organizing phenotypic information from scientific literature, these technologies can significantly enhance genotype-phenotype mapping, making it more complete and informative.
Taking advantage of the platform provided by BLAH9, I would like to propose this project focusing on the annotation of feline phenotype-genotype information from literature by applying NLP or LLMs. With the collaboration and expertise of talented individuals like you, we can make this project a reality.
